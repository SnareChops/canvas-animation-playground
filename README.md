# Canvas Animation Playground

This was just a simple proof of concept repo for testing animations and stuff in HTML canvas

## Dependencies

The runtime code itself has no dependencies at all, however to make building the TypeScript easier, there is an included `run` shell script that uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#install-esbuild) and [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to build and serve the javascript. Feel free to use any other tool you prefer instead.
